        <h1>Imprint & Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Imprint</h2>
        <p>This website is operated exclusively for family and private purposes.<br>
            It is a private project without any commercial intentions, designed to organize internal family processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Information</h2>
        <p>We take the protection of your data seriously, even within our small family circle. Here is a brief
            overview
            of what happens when you use this app:</p>

        <h3>1. What data is collected?</h3>
        <p>To ensure the features of the app (e.g., voting on names or reserving flea market items) function
            properly, we
            store the following information locally on our own server:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entered Names:</strong> The names you enter when making suggestions, in the flea market ("I'll
                get it") or as comments.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Addresses (temporary):</strong> To prevent someone (or a bot) from voting 100 times, and
                to
                protect against overload ("Rate Limiting"), we store your device's IP address anonymously or
                temporarily at the time of voting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Hosting and Service Providers</h3>
        <p>The app is hosted completely on our private home server. Your name suggestions and comments do not leave
            our
            home. There is no evaluation by third parties (like Google Analytics, Facebook, etc.).</p>
        <p>To make the site securely accessible from the internet, we use the Cloudflare service. This routes the
            data
            traffic (like a kind of protective shield) to our server and stores technically necessary connection data
            (e.g., IP addresses) in accordance with its own <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> use any tracking or advertising cookies. The app only stores technically
            strictly
            necessary data in the so-called "Local Storage" of your browser (e.g., whether you have activated the
            admin
            mode) to guarantee the functionality of the site.</p>

        <h3>4. Deletion of Data</h3>
        <p>As soon as our baby is here and the app has fulfilled its purpose, the entire server will be shut down
            and
            all associated data will be completely deleted.</p>
